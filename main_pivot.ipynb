For example, rather than store address details in a single address field, it’s usually better to split it down into *house_number*, *street_name*, *city*, and *country* component fields. This allows you to analyze it by individual streets, cities, or countries more easily.\n",

    "In addition, you’ll also be able to use the data from individual columns more readily in calculations. For example, if you had columns *room_length* and *room_width*, they can be multiplied together to give you room area information. If both values are stored together in a single column in a format such as \"10 x 5\", the calculation becomes more awkward.\n",

    "## How to Create Your First Pivot Table With pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your learning journey is underway, it’s time to progress toward your first learning milestone and complete the following task:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculate the total sales for each type of order for each region.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you create a pivot table, you should first consider how you want the data to be displayed. One approach would be to have a separate column for each product category and a separate row for each region. The total sales for each product category for each region could then be placed in the intersection of each row and column.\n",
    "\n",
    " You need to translate your plan into the parameters required by the DataFrame.pivot_table() method. In this case, the parameters you need are **values**, **index**, **columns**, and **aggfunc**. It’s important to understand what these are for because they’re the core parameters used in most pivot tables.\n",
    "\n",
    " Your pivot table will perform its calculations based on the sale price figures. These become the values passed to the **values** parameter, giving your pivot table the figures it needs to work with. If you don’t specify this parameter, the pivot table will use all numeric columns by default.\n",
    "\n",
    " The **index** parameter is where you specify how the data is to be grouped. Remember, you need to find the total sales for each type of order for each region. You’ve decided to produce a row of aggregated data based on the *sales_region* field, so this will be passed as the index parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    " You also want a separate column for each order type. This will be assigned to the **columns** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    " Finally, you also need to tell your pivot table that you want to calculate the total sales for each aggregation. To create a simple pivot table, you set its **aggfunc** parameter to, in this case, the sum() function.\n",
    "\n",
    " Now that you’ve fully thought through your plan, you can go ahead and code your pivot table:"
